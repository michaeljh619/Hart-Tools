Description:
	This is the Background package, it provides classes for rendering
background images to a game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How it Works:
	Each background has its own way of rendering to the screen, check out its
render method for info. Some backgrounds may need to be updated and take
CameraDimensions as a parameter.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How the Dev should use this package:
	Create a background and render it before you render your sprites (or
whenever your background should be rendered). Note that backgrounds are not
sprites, since normally they don't need updates to work, however some back-
grounds may need updates if they have more complex behaviors.
