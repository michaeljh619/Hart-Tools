Description:
	This is the Renderable package, it contains classes for renderable objects.
Sprites have a RenderableObject pointer that can be built with a constructor;
once a Sprite has a RenderableObject, it will automatically render it centered
at its origin when its render method is called.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How it Works:
	Renderable objects are merely extensions of LibGDX's TextureRegion and
Animation classes. The problem I faced when creating sprites was that I needed
an object that could take either an Animation or a TextureRegion, since
essentially they do the same thing by just being rendered to the screen. The
generic RenderableObject has one method, getTextureRegion(float runtime), this
method allows both an Animation and a TextureRegion to behave the same way by
returning the TextureRegion if its a RenderableTR and gets the current frame
if its a RenderableAnim.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How the Dev should use this package:
	Use the classes just like LibGDX Animation and TextureRegion. To take
advantage of what this class offers, you can have some generic RenderableObject
and then polymorphically cast it to either a RenderableTextureRegion or a
RenderableAnimation depending on what you need. Then when rendering the
RenderableObject, just call its getTextureRegion with the correct runtime and
you can render the TextureRegion that's returned without ever knowing whether
the RenderableObject is an Animation or TextureRegion!
