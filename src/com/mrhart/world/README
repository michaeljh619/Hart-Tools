Package: com.mrhart.world
Name: World Package

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
	This is the "world" package of Hart Tools. This package contains the 
GameWorld and the GameRenderer. The GameWorld is responsible for updating all
objects and the GameRenderer is responsible for rendering those objects to the
screen.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How it Works:
	Inside GameScreen, GameWorld's update method is called first with delta passed in
as an argument and GameRenderer's render method is called second with runtime passed
in as an argument.

- GameWorld -
	GameWorld uses objects of type Mode for for its updates. At any given time,
GameWorld has a mode that is its current Mode. This current Mode is the one
that will be updated and rendered. Each Mode has an AssetManager that may or
may not have assets that need to be loaded. If there are any assets that need
to be loaded, GameWorld will load these assets first before trying to update
the current Mode.
	If the loading of these assets occur for current Mode, then the current
Mode's update function will not be called and GameWorld will load the assets in
the current Mode's AssetManager in little blocks each CPU cycle. While this is
occurring, GameRenderer will render the loading screen using GameWorld's meta-
assets (essentially loading screen assets), using GameRenderer's 
renderLoadingScreen function.

- GameRenderer -
	GameRenderer calls the current Mode's (current Mode in GameWorld's) render
function to render everything to the screen. These render functions take an
initialized SpriteBatch object and the current running time in the game (for
Animations). As stated before, if the current Mode's assets are not loaded yet,
then GameRenderer will render a loading screen, which can be customized by the
dev.
	Before the SpriteBatch is initialized (and thus before any render calls are made), 
GameRenderer clears the background and allows for blending to occur. Clearing the 
background essentially means that the background is set to black, although this 
should NOT be used as a black background! In other words, if you want your game to
have a black background, you should actually create a black background to
render there.
	After render is done calling, GameRenderer checks if the current Mode has
implemented the interface Debuggable. Debuggable Interface allows you to render
shapes to the screen for debugging. If the mode is Debuggable, then its "debug"
method will be called and passed an initialized ShapeRenderer for rendering
shapes wherever the developer sees fit. Usually these come in the form of
rendering these shapes as collision boxes.
