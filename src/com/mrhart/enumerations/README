Package: com.mrhart.enumerations
Name: Enumerations Package

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
	This is the "enumerations" package of Hart Tools. It will contain classes
with static named constants and static methods for enumerations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How it Works:
	This package is pretty self explanatory. Essentially classes will have
named constants which can be accessed with the classes name.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How the Dev should use this package:
	As stated before, this package requires virtually no code modification. For
the large majority of projects, these classes can run stand-alone. Places that
could be modified would include the resizing, pausing, and hiding functions in
`GameScreen`; these functions are called when the respective action is
performed (e.g. pause is called when your application has been paused).
