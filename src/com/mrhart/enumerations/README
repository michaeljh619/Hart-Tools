Description:
	This is the "enumerations" package of Hart Tools. It will contain classes
with static named constants and static methods for enumerations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How it Works:
	This package is pretty self explanatory. Essentially all classes in this
package are enumerations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How the Dev should use this package:
	Access enumerations through the classes in this package and use however you
need. Lots of support packages make use of these enumerations (e.g. Direction
in joysticks and keyboard arrows).
