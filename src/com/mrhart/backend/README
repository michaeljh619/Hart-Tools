Package: com.mrhart.backend
Name: Backend Package
Type: Support
Version: v2.01

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Updates:
	v2.01
- Removed Initializer class from this package and moved it to the Main package.
It makes more sense there, since it is considered a System class.
	v2.00
- Massive overhaul of system.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
	This is the Backend package, it provides supporting functions for math and
common procedures that a developer may need.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How it Works:
	Static functions in this class will allow developers to cut down on code
size.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How the Dev should use this package:
	Self-explanatory really, there are lots of common functions in this package
to help reduce code size. For example, if you have a 360.0 degree rotation
scale and you need to perform addition, adding two degrees together, the
Rotation class has functions for that. Note that a lot of common functions can
be found in Java standard library classes; however, I found that there were
some functions missing and took the liberty of making those here.
