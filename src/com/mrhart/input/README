Name: Input Package
Type: Support
Version: v2.00

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Updates:
	v2.00
- Massive overhaul of system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
	This is the Input package, it provides classes that allow the user to give
some type of input to the game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How it Works:
	Some objects in this package will be onscreen, as in Joysticks and Buttons,
and others may just detect things, like KeyboardArrows. Most classes will need
to have an update function called, as they check for touches, keystrokes, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How the Dev should use this package:
	Create your input object and detect your input. Usually you want to detect
your input before any Sprite updates, if you have some Sprite that moves when
something is pressed, you want it to occur immediately and not be delayed until
the next cycle. The onscreen objects also need to be rendered to the screen,
and more than likely will be rendered after all other objects have been
rendered (you want your user to see the UI!).
