Name: Concrete Mode Package
Type: User Defined
Version: v2.00

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Updates:
	v2.00
- Massive overhaul of system.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
	This is the Concrete Mode package, user defined classes are placed here for
organization of Modes. Some testing Modes are provided, feel free to delete
these when creating your final executable, as you will not need most of them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How it Works:
	As all user defined classes go, it is just meant for creating subclasses of
Mode in here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How the Dev should use this package:
	Create classes of type Mode and place them in here. This is where most of
the work from your team should go.
