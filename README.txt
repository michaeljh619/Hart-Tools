This repository contains all the tools I use to make video games with libgdx. Feel
free to use them all you want in you video game making adventures! There are no
requirements for using my code, however I would deeply appreciate two things and
both are completely optional:
1.) Please provide a link to this repository so others can use these tools as well.
2.) Send me an email so I can check out your video game!

If you have any questions on how anything works, feel free to email me.
