	After performing tests on various amounts of Sprites, I can see that the optimized version clearly outperforms the naive version of collision handling. At very low quantities of Sprites, the optimized version barely outperforms the Naive implementation (and in some cases, the naive version can even outperform the Optimized version). This is due to the fact that there is some overhead involved in using the SortedList removals and inserts. However, at large quantities (in the bench test you begin to see it at 150 objects), the overhead no longer takes as large as a toll as before. In conclusion, the naive implementation should be deprecated and removed, as the benefit at low quantities is not enough to justify using it.
