*************************************************
- Read the README for more details on naive versus optimized implementation.
- 1000 CPU cycles are tested and the average amount of time spent between all those CPU cycles is returned.
- Note that we are ONLY testing the amount of time collision handling takes and not including Sprite updates and rendering, which only add constant time anyway to both.
- All timed amounts are in microseconds.
