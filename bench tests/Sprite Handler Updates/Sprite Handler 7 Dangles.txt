*************************************************
- These are bench tests for testing SpriteHandler's non-
threaded update versus its threaded update. 
- Some very simple objects were tested whose updates and 
collisions were not very complex.  Remember that if all these 
objects had higher update times, that we would need to take that
into account as well. 
- All timed amounts are in nanoseconds.
